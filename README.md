 Summary of the HTML Code:

This HTML page showcases a collection of traditional crafts from Tamil Nadu, with a background image and some stylized text describing different crafts like pottery, wood crafts, and mats. Here's a breakdown of the page:

1. **Styling**:
   - The page uses inline CSS for basic styling.
   - **Background**: A background image (`art.jpeg`) is applied to the body. It has a semi-transparent white overlay (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)`) and a `background-blend-mode` set to `overlay`, which blends the background image with the white color.
   - **Text**: Paragraph text (`<p>`) is styled with bold font weight.

2. **Content**:
   - The page is divided into sections that highlight different crafts:
     1. **Pottery**: Describes the traditional pottery craft of Tamil Nadu, particularly from Arcot and Tirunelveli districts. It mentions the types of pottery produced and the materials used (red, black, and grey clay).
     2. **Wood Crafts**: Describes the woodcraft traditions from places like Virudunagar, Devakottai, Karaikkudi, and Madurai. Highlights include wood panels, carvings, and rosewood craftsmanship.
     3. **Mats (Pattamadai Mats)**: Describes the weaving of reed mats in Pattamadai village. The mats are crafted from korai grass and feature traditional colors like red, green, and black.

3. **Images**:
   - Images (`pot.jpeg`, `wood.jpeg`, `mats.jpeg`) are included after each craft description. Each image is centered and has a specified width of 400px.

4. **Back Button**:
   - A fixed "Back" button is positioned in the top left corner of the screen. The button has a custom design with a black background, white text, rounded corners, and a hover effect. The button uses JavaScript (`onclick="window.history.back();"`) to navigate the user back to the previous page when clicked.

### Issues & Suggestions:
- The **`<br>`** tag in the `<center><img src="pot.jpeg" width="400"></center><br.` is incomplete and should be corrected to `<br>` for proper line break functionality.
- The **back button's border style** is incomplete in the inline CSS (`border:=""`). This should be fixed or removed.
