            Pottery
        </h2>
        <p>Pottery is another traditional craft of the Tamil people. Especially painting yellow colour on black pottery is a main craft in Tamil Nadu. In the Arcot district, people made minor deities and toys with clay. This is the main occupation of many people in the Arcot district. In the same community, people prepare stylish crafts with clay: water jugs, dinner sets, flower vases, paper waits and decorative animals. People in every neighbourhood make artificial designs, which bring a lot of richness to the places where they decorate them. Tirunelveli district crafts are used with high technique, and the objects are beautiful. The things are made with red, black and grey clay, adding a shining effect with various colours at the finish.</p>

        <h2>Wood Crafts</h2>
        <p>In Tamil Nadu there are a number of places noted for wood craft. Virudunagar is famous for the traditional style. It has now started making articles for household use. Devakottai and Karaikkudi make traditional panels in different sizes. Small shrines finely carved with wood known as kavadi have exquisite designs and serve as votive offerings to the deity that devotees carry on their heads as they go singing or chanting. </p>
        <p>Madurai is famous for its rosewood carvings. The style is marked by its bold forms, the details being minutely and painstakingly worked out. Tables with the top covered with floral motifs or lovely parrots or panels with epic scenes are the most outstanding examples of this type of craft.</p>
