        <h2>Early History</h2>
        <p>The political state of Tamil Nadu in India was created in 1969 instead of the former Madras State. The history of Tamil Nadu goes back to the early Stone Age. Tamil Nadu (now one of the states in the south of the Republic of India) has been under continuous human habitation since prehistoric times.</p>
        <p>The names of the three dynasties, Cholas, Pandyas, and Keralaputras or Cheras are mentioned in the Pillars of Ashoka (inscribed 273â€“232 BCE) inscriptions, where they are mentioned among the kingdoms, which though not subject to Ashoka, were on friendly terms with him.</p>

      <center><h2>Age Of Emperors</h2>
        <p>The medieval period of the history of the Tamil country saw the rise and fall of many kingdoms, some became empires, exerting influences both in India and overseas. The Hindu sects Saivism and Vaishnavism became more dominant, with temples being built and Dravidian architecture being supported by empires replacing the significance of Nastik Jainism and Buddhism. Some of the output of villages throughout the kingdom was given to temples that reinvested some of the wealth accumulated as loans to the settlements.

       <p>Tamil Nadu represents the Tamil-speaking area of what was formerly the Madras Presidency of British India. The Tamils are especially proud of their Dravidian language and culture, and they have notably resisted attempts by the central government to make Hindi (an Indo-Aryan language) the sole national language. While it has an industrial core in Chennai, the state is essentially agricultural. Area 50,216 square miles (130,058 square km). Pop. (2011) 72,138,958.</p>
